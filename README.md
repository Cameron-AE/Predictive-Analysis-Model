Created Logistics related Predictive Analysis Models using multiple different Algorithms with Scikit-learn to predict targets such as<br>
-Mileage<br>
-Fuel Consumption<br>
-Repair Count(per year)<br><br>
Models were trained with **Synthetic Data** with strong linear correlations between features and targets <br><br>
Algorithms used:<br>
-Linear Regression<br>
-Random Forest<br>
-Gradient Boosting<br><br>
Linear Regression is the primary model in this project, as it achieved the best performance (predictions within a 10% error threshold), which aligns with the intentionally linear structure of the synthetic data.
