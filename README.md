Created Predictive Analysis Models using multiple different Algorithms with Scikit-learn to predict targets such as<br>
-Mileage<br>
-Fuel Consumption<br>
-Repair Count(per year)<br><br>
Model is trained with highly correlated **Synthetic Data**<br><br>
Algorithms used:<br>
-Linear Regression<br>
-Random Forest<br>
-Gradient Boosting<br><br>
Linear Regression is the key model in this project as it had the best accuracy scores within a 10% threshold due to the data being generated with high linear correlation
